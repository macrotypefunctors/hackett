we need to turn opaque-type-transformers into alias-transformers
instead of var-like-transformers so that #%type:app isn't recklessly
inserted. one justifaction for this is that opaque types actually
cannot be curried, since they may be "hiding" a type alias, not a data
type.

opaque types should expand into ((#%type:con #%apply-type) ...); a
u-type-app just like what we do in rep/sig.rkt. then we can resugar
them and the result will be the correct representation.

it may be nice if they shared a gensym property, so that Î»m and mod
can more easily call resugar without having to know of every type that
needs resugaring.
