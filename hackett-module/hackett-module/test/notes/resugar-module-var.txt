we need to turn opaque-type-transformers into alias-transformers
instead of var-like-transformers so that #%type:app isn't recklessly
inserted. one justifaction for this is that opaque types actually
cannot be curried, since they may be "hiding" a type alias, not a data
type.

opaque types should expand into ((#%type:con #%apply-type) ...); a
u-type-app just like what we do in rep/sig.rkt. then we can resugar
them and the result will be the correct representation.

it may be nice if they shared a gensym property, so that λm and mod
can more easily call resugar without having to know of every type that
needs resugaring.

That's fine for opaque types, but data types might require something
else. They need to interact with pattern matching, so they do have to
be represented as (#%type:con data:M.D123). Is there a generic mechanism
for doing both opaque types as ((#%type:con #%apply-type) ...) and
data types as (#%type:con data:M.D123) ?
